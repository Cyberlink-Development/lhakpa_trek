(80, 130, 'What do I need to know about Nepal ?', 'Currency\r\nNepal’s central bank, the Nepal Rastra Bank, is currently in the process of phasing out old rupee notes depicting portraits of ex-kings, with new notes displaying Mount Everest. While the old notes are still accepted in limited areas of the country, it is advisable to ensure that all of the notes you receive, when exchanging currency, depict Mount Everest.\r\nThere are many official exchange services in Kathmandu — specifically at the Kathmandu Airport, exchange houses, and most banks in the city. A few of the larger hotels may offer exchange services but this is not guaranteed.\r\nAs the airport is quite small and can be crowded and chaotic, we suggest waiting until you arrive in town to exchange your money.\r\nFor your convenience and the best exchange rate, we strongly suggest exchanging all the money you will need for your Nepal tour before departing Kathmandu.\r\nBe sure to keep your exchange receipts, as you may need to present them if converting excess currency upon departure from Nepal.\r\nA few art and craft shops (not convenience stores) will accept USD. However, to ensure the best exchange rate, we recommend changing your money into local currency.\r\nPayment in hotels, travel agencies, and airlines is made in foreign exchange. Credit cards like MasterCard, Visa, and occasionally American Express, are widely accepted at major hotels, shops, and restaurants.\r\nGuests are required to keep their Foreign Exchange Encashment Receipt while making foreign exchange payments or transferring foreign currency into Nepalese Rupees. The receipts may be needed to change left-over Nepalese Rupees back into hard currency before leaving the country. However, only 10 percent of the total amount may be converted by the bank.\r\nATMs are widely available in Kathmandu.\r\nOn arrival, it is a good idea to change some money into small denominations – useful for shopping as there is rarely any change.\r\nBoth Euro and USD travellers’ cheques can be cashed relatively easily in most banks and major hotels throughout the country.\r\nPhotography\r\nPlease be sensitive when photographing people. The Nepalese are renowned for being friendly; however it is courteous to ask permission before snapping away.\r\nIf you are shooting digital and plan to take a large number of photos, be sure to bring enough memory cards or your own computer equipment/image tank onto which you can download your pictures.\r\nPassport & Visa Requirements\r\nGuests must hold both a valid passport and visa.\r\nVisas may be purchased at the border (if travelling overland) or at Kathmandu Airport.\r\nVisa processing can take up to an hour, especially during the peak season (September-May). It is advisable to arrange for a visa before entering the country. Please consult with a local Nepalese consulate.\r\nIf purchasing a visa in Nepal, guests are required to have a passport with at least two blank pages, money (tourist visa fee given below), and a passport-sized photo.\r\nTourist Visa: Good for multi entry\r\n15 days: USD 25 or equivalent convertible currency\r\n30 days: USD 40 or equivalent convertible currency\r\n90 days: USD 100 or equivalent convertible currency\r\nTourist Visa Extension: The visa extension fee for 15 days or less is USD30 or equivalent convertible currency. The visa extension fee for more than 15 days is USD2 per day. Tourist visas can be extended for a maximum period of 150 days in a single visa year (January – December).\r\nTransit Visa: Guests using the airports of Nepal for their onward journey to other countries are eligible for this visa. The visais issued for 24 hours.\r\nLuggage allowance\r\nBaggage weight on small planes in the mountains is restricted to 20kg (40 lbs), and occasionally 15kg (33 lbs). Excess baggage may have to wait for available space on a later flight.\r\nWhat the Experts Say\r\nInternet facilities are available in all cities however in rural areas the internet service may not be consistent.', NULL, '1726745379.jpeg', 66, 'What-do-I-need-to-know-about-Nepal-', '1726745379669', NULL, '2024-09-19 11:29:39', '2024-09-19 11:29:39');

In addition to that, a foreigner isn\'t allowed to purchase insurance on Nepali soil. Both facts indicate a client\'s requirement to buy an elaborate travel insurance plan in their place of origin that protects their interest. Be that in trip cancellation, helicopter evacuation, medical emergencies, other illnesses, lost luggage, theft, disasters, death, etc.<br><br>There is a fine line between adventure and blatant risk. What separates them is the preparation level for a particular activity. However, leaving behind the comforts of your home into the embrace of nature –an adventure and not ensuring that you are adequately insured – is a risk. Therefore, Shangrila Eco Trek requests that you purchase comprehensive insurance to cover all possibilities that may ensue during your stay in Nepal.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"sppb-addon-title\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Points to remember regarding your Travel Insurance Plan:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">In case of accidents, or sickness, evacuation may be necessary by helicopter. The tourism agencies can make helicopter evacuation provisions but refrain from involving themselves in financial matters. And even if they do, they will seek compensation for their expenses. Therefore, the resulting costs can be back-breaking if you do not obtain an insurance plan explicitly covering helicopter rescue.<br><br></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides the rescue, medical treatments for accidents in high altitudes and cold temperatures are expensive. Moreover, in certain instances, a mobile medical team will have to accompany the helicopter crew to the base camps, which further increases the medical expenses. Hence, it is necessary that you are correctly insured for probable medical conditions.<br><br></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">While purchasing insurance, it is wise to thoroughly explain what you\'re getting into and ensure that your insurance agent understands you. Your itinerary should be disclosed, and the risks involved should be openly discussed before picking an insurance plan. This allows you to understand what is agreeable to the insurance company. Besides, it also makes claiming insurance more accessible in case the above circumstances occur.<br><br></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consultation with multiple insurance providers before finally picking an insurance policy can be helpful. However, mountaineering is challenging and never devoid of specific risks. So, it is necessary to mention \'mountaineering\' or \'alpinism\' while explaining to the insurance providers your needs.<br><br></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the deposits made by a client are not refundable because of the company\'s obligations, the client must also be insured against trip cancellation.<br><br></li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The client must provide us with a copy of your insurance policy (or insurance certificate) so that we can take due steps during emergencies.</li>\r\n</ol>', NULL, 'travel-insurance', '1689580784664', 24, NULL, 0, 8, NULL, 'e163a6a1-1af1-47ed-a9c9-b2acb6c6b558-tiVbU.jpeg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 560, 'en', '2023-07-17 07:59:44', '2024-10-16 07:10:11'),

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases. Often salespeople in your local shop do not have first hand knowledge of high-altitude climbing, so be sure to balance their advice with what you read here. We have strived to create a list heavy on detail, but there are always further questions!</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During your adventure in Nepal you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range are the pleasantly warm and beautiful lowlands around Lukla, while at the other end of the spectrum is the cold and often windy weather up amongst the glaciers and the highest peaks in the world, before summit day itself. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. Adhere to the layering principle: several thin layers of insulation (rather than one thick one).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our list on the trek and expedition package is a guide only . While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, even borrow, and use your experience with our list to find the best gear for you. Purchasing the specific items listed below will ensure you have the right tool for the job, but there are other options on the market.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>A Note on Packing </strong></p>\r\n<p>For your international flights, we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags or suitcase. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the trek. Generally, you will take one duffel on the trek , and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such water, layering, blister kit, and camera</p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">As the weather condition is unpredictable in the Himalayan region, you need to be prepared at all times. A day can start sunny with clear skies and later become cold and windy at the high altitudes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">Sometimes, it can rain and snow during the trekking period.  You need to remember that for a successful trekking journey, your physical comfort must be the first priority.</p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \"><strong>Note:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">Please note that the items listed on the equipment list vary according to the season, trek duration. Please remember that your luggage will be carried by the porter, but you need to carry a daypack on your own. We also suggest you pack only necessary items to keep the weight of your equipment to a minimum.</p>', NULL, 'gear-list', '1689582480636', 24, NULL, 0, 9, '1726743586.jpeg', 'de741d45-0b49-47a8-a72e-f1b5e744c024-ZT2yf.jpeg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 570, 'en', '2023-07-17 08:28:00', '2024-10-16 05:20:57'),

Considered a paradise for the mountaineering and other adventurous activities, it has something for every nature of adventure lovers. Home to 8 of the 14 peaks highest peaks in the world including the tallest Everest (8848m), Nepal has 1310 mountain peaks out of which 326 of them are open for the purpose of climbing and mountaineering. This makes the tiny Himalayan nation exceptionally popular for mountaineering. Climbing the formidable peaks in Nepal has been the synonym for outstanding achievement and display of courage as this require cautious longer planning and preparation along with physical fitness.</p>\r\n<p><br>Nepal is home to several other mountains below the mighty above 8000m peaks. This makes the peak climbing in Nepal ideal to those who have some form of trekking experience and want to test themselves further in the adventure tourism. Many smaller mountains known as ‘Nepal Trekking Peaks’ (5650m to 6500m) are more than simple trekking. Some of these peaks are Mera Peak, Lobuche Peak and Island Peak. 33 such peaks are open for climbing managed under the label of ‘Trekking Peaks’ by Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). Similarly, expeditions to the peaks ranging below 8000m fall under another range of mountains for peak climbing. Pumori, Barunste are some of the peaks of this range. Above 8000m are the snow-capped peaks which occupy the top category for peak climbing. Mt Everest, Mt. Annapurna, Mt. Makalu, Mt. Manaslu, Mt Dhaulagiri are some of these peaks above 8000m. However, some of the peaks below 6812m range also require technically assistance for the purpose of climbing besides the higher ones. Island Peak is considered technically more difficult than Mera Peak, though they fall in the same appellation.</p>\r\n<p>Best Season<br>Generally, spring season (April to early June) is considered as the best season for Mountaineering/Peak climbing. It was once the only permission season for mountaineering. In recent years autumn season (September to November) is also the period for successful expeditions. In 1979, Ministry of Tourism established a season for winter mountaineering. For season of November to February, technological advances have allowed ascend to the peaks. Monsoon season (July to August) isn’t the practical season for peak climbing.</p>\r\n<p>Permit Requirement<br>Mountaineers need to have permission from the Ministry of Tourism for the purpose of peak climbing, though Liaison Officer isn’t needed for climbing peaks below 6500m. Recently, Ministry of Tourism decided to withdraw the authority to manage the 33 trekking peaks from Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), given to it since 1978. The royalty fees have also been revised by the government to further promote mountaineering in Nepal.<br>How is Trekking different from Mountaineering?<br>As per Nepal Mountaineering Association there are 33 peaks as the Trekking Peaks in Nepal which is relatively confusing as all involve climbing. Trekking peaks means more of the trip that consists mainly the trekking activities with few of days of ascending a glacier to a high camp and then a summit day with some technical climbing, rather than the expedition involving a base camp and using siege tactics to climb a mountain. Mountaineering is the need of climbing equipment to ascend the mountain that includes the crossing of glacier, crossing snow field with crampons, climbing steep ice wall with an ice axe and so on. So, trekking is bit different from mountaineering in terms of technicality and ease.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: \'Calibri\',\'sans-serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">The haven for mountaineering and Peak Climbing, Nepal has in offer different technical and relatively less difficult peaks for mountaineering.

Home to some of the rarest species of flora and fauna, it stretches from the subtropical forests and bushes to the Alpine vegetation, trans-Himalaya region and the lofty Himalayas. From the habitat of the Royal Bengal tiger to the hunting ground of Snow leopard, from the fertile lands of the plains in the south to the lush hilly region and the snowy yet rough terrain, Nepal has a lot in terms of diversity in a small territory. From the steamy lands and jungles in the morning, you can be in the foothills of the ridges of a valley in the late afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>The diversity in cultural and archaeological as well as the historical dimension is much more than the physical diversity displayed by the ever-enchanting Nepal. With an extensive presence of distinctive ethnic and cultural communities speaking a different variety of languages, varied traditions and values, festivals and rituals Nepal also has pagoda styled Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries coexisting in harmony. From the Indian style, Hinduism to the Tibetan influenced Buddhism; from the nature-worshipping Shamanism to the indigenous Newar community, all share a distinct place in this tiny yet culturally rich nation.</p>\r\n<p>A proud nation since its inception from the integration of smaller princely states by the Shah king Prithvi Narayan Shah, Nepal has never been colonized.

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases. Often salespeople in your local shop do not have first hand knowledge of high-altitude climbing, so be sure to balance their advice with what you read here. We have strived to create a list heavy on detail, but there are always further questions!</p>\r\n<p>During your expedition in Nepal you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range are the pleasantly warm and beautiful lowlands around Lukla, while at the other end of the spectrum is the cold and often windy weather up amongst the glaciers and the highest peaks in the world, before summit day itself. The equipment you<br>bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. Adhere to the layering principle: several thin layers of insulation (rather than one thick one).</p>\r\n<p>This list is a guide. While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, even borrow, and use your experience with our list to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p>Purchasing the specific items listed below will ensure you have the right tool for the job, but there are other options on the market.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A note on the packing </strong></p>\r\n<p>For your international 9lights, we recommend that you pack all your<br>equipment in your two larger duf9le bags. Do not simply pack your<br>backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling<br>machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending<br>on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA<br>has searched the bags. If not, lock the bags with zip ties. If the TSA cuts<br>off the zip tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need<br>the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition.  Generally, you will take two duffels up to Base Camp, and leave the<br>third in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for time in the<br>city. ONE of the duffels going up to Base Camp can be sent on ahead<br>(with items not needed for the trek in, such as climbing gear) and this<br>bag will not be seen until we arrive at Base Camp. The other will be<br>accessible during the trek in the evenings (with items that are needed for<br>the trek in such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag). SO it’s easy – 1st<br>bag is with you, the 2nd is ahead going up to BC and the 3rd is left<br>behind for afterward – 3 duffels!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 accomodation-block\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"text-box\">\r\n<div class=\"holder\"><strong class=\"title\">Equipment Checklist</strong>\r\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\r\n<p><strong>       Body Wear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Waterproof shell jacket</li>\r\n<li>Waterproof shell pants</li>\r\n<li>Expedition down jacket and pants</li>\r\n<li>Base Camp down jacket</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight insulated pants (Optional)</li>\r\n<li>Midweight insulated jacket</li>\r\n<li>Softshell climbing pants</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight fleece top and pants</li>\r\n<li>Windshirt (Optional)</li>\r\n<li>Trekking/glacier shirt</li>\r\n<li>Base layer tops x 3 and leggings x 2</li>\r\n<li>Underwear x 5-6 pairs</li>\r\n<li>Trekking clothes</li>\r\n<li>Casual wear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>      Head Wear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Warm hat</li>\r\n<li>Sun hat</li>\r\n<li>Balaclava (Optional)</li>\r\n<li>Bandana and/or Buff</li>\r\n<li>Neoprene face mask (Optional)</li>\r\n<li>Neck Gaiter or Fleece Buff (Optional)</li>\r\n<li>Sun glasses x 2 pairs</li>\r\n<li>Ski goggles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>       Hand Wear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liner gloves x 2 pairs</li>\r\n<li>Fleece gloves x 2 pairs</li>\r\n<li>Mountaineering gloves with removable liners</li>\r\n<li>Expedition mitts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>        Foot Wear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Socks x 6 pairs</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight shoes/sandals</li>\r\n<li>Trekking boots</li>\r\n<li>8000m mountaineering boots</li>\r\n<li>6000m mountaineering boots (Optional)</li>\r\n<li>Snow gaiters</li>\r\n<li>Down bivvy boots</li>\r\n<li>Camp boots (Optional)</li>\r\n<li>Foot-warming system (Optional)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>         Packs &amp;

This is a challenging high-altitude trek combined with an introductory mountaineering experience. Skiing in Mera Peak is one of the best ways to get thrilling experiences. Skiing in the Himalayan might be a dream for every adventurous Skier. It is high altitude trek combined with skiing, mountaineering, and trekking. Nepal’s highest trekking peak lies on the edge of the famous Khumbu Region, from where it unfolds the most exceptional panoramic views of five 8000 meter mountains including Mount Everest. Although Mera Peak is very high, the climbing is straightforward. This trip is ideal for those with moderate mountaineering experience, a good level of fitness, and a keen sense of adventure.

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases.</p>\r\n<p>This list is a guide. While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, use your experience and the listed features to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p>During your time in the mountains, you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather of the highest peaks in the world. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. The layering principle, based on several thin layers of insulation<br>(rather than one thick one), covered with an outer weatherproof shell, meets these needs well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Note on Packing </strong></p>\r\n<p>For your international flights, we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition. Generally, you will take one duffel up to Base Camp, and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city.

At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather  of the highest peaks in the world.

If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it.

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases.</p>\r\n<p>This list is a guide. While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, use your experience and the listed features to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p>During your time in the mountains, you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather of the highest peaks in the world. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. The layering principle, based on several thin layers of insulation<br>(rather than one thick one), covered with an outer weatherproof shell, meets these needs well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Note on Packing </strong></p>\r\n<p>For your international flights, we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition. Generally, you will take one duffel up to Base Camp, and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such as water, layering, blister kit, and camera.</p>\r\n<p><strong>     Important Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don’t cut corners on the quality of gears</li>\r\n<li>Understand the function of each gear properly</li>\r\n<li>Acquire your gears well in advance</li>\r\n<li>Eliminate unnecessary luxuries</li>\r\n<li>Seasonal fluctuation will impact the requirement of gear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>      Tips:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can always rent gears if you are not willing to invest</li>\r\n<li>Check the sizes especially of boots before leaving for the mountain</li>\r\n<li>Wear summit socks while trying the boots.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 accomodation-block\">\r\n<div class=\"text-box\">\r\n<div class=\"holder\"><strong class=\"title\">Equipment and packing list </strong>\r\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\r\n<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thermal Base Layers – Tops and Bottoms</li>\r\n<li>Heavy Base Layers</li>\r\n<li>Trekking Pants</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell pants</li>\r\n<li>Down Pant</li>\r\n<li>T-shirts – Short and long sleeve</li>\r\n<li>Mid Layer Top</li>\r\n<li>Insulated Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Down Jacket/Parka</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Footwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Double insulated mountaineering boots for climbing</li>\r\n<li>Hiking boots (Full and waterproof) for approach</li>\r\n<li>lightweight shoes for camp and around town</li>\r\n<li>Gaiters</li>\r\n<li>Flip-flops</li>\r\n<li>Wool/Synthetic socks</li>\r\n<li>Liner socks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Handwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liner gloves</li>\r\n<li>Mid-weight gloves</li>\r\n<li>Down mittens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Headwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cap/Sun Hat</li>\r\n<li>Buff</li>\r\n<li>Balaclava</li>\r\n<li>Warm wool/Synthetic Hat</li>\r\n<li>Eye Wear (Full coverage around eyes and nose)</li>\r\n<li>Ski Goggles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Climbing Gears</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Helmet</li>\r\n<li>Ice Axe with a waist leash</li>\r\n<li>Mountaineering Crampons</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight Mountaineering Harness</li>\r\n<li>Carabiners (2 Screwgate and 2 Snapgate)</li>\r\n<li>Belay Device(ATC Guide or Figure 8)</li>\r\n<li>Ascender/Jumar</li>\r\n<li>Prussik /Accessory Cord</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Backpacking</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small pack (35-40 liters)</li>\r\n<li>Waterproof duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Padlocks for the duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Pack cover</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>  Accessories</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Water Bottles: 2 bottles of 1 litre each with insulation cover</li>\r\n<li>Trekking poles</li>\r\n<li>Headlamp: 200-300 lumens with spare batteries</li>\r\n<li>Camera</li>\r\n<li>Power bank/Solar Charger</li>\r\n<li>Universal adapter</li>\r\n<li>Notebooks/Diary</li>\r\n<li>Pocket knife</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Hygiene and first aid</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Skincare (Maximum SPF sunscreen and lip balm)</li>\r\n<li>Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Soap, Moisturizer</li>\r\n<li>Hand Sanitizer</li>\r\n<li>Toilet paper and wet wipes</li>\r\n<li>Personal first aid kit (Include personal prescriptions, high altitude medications, painkillers, first-aid tape, band-aids etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Water treatment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Others</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comfort Foods (Bring snacks and foods you like to munch)</li>\r\n<li>Travel clothes to wear in Kathmandu</li>\r\n<li>Sleeping bag (-20 degrees sleeping bag)</li>\r\n<li>Inflatable mattress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '<p>Mera Peak climbing offers an exclusive opportunity to summit highest trekking peak of Nepal at 6476 meters with excellent views of eight thousanders like Makalu, Lhotse,Cho Oyu ,KanchenjungaincludingtopoftheworldMt.Everest.

Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, use your experience and the listed features to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p>During your time in the mountains, you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather of the highest peaks in the world. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. The layering principle, based on several thin layers of insulation<br>(rather than one thick one), covered with an outer weatherproof shell, meets these needs well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Note on Packing </strong></p>\r\n<p>For your international flights, we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition. Generally, you will take one duffel up to Base Camp, and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such as water, layering, blister kit, and camera.</p>\r\n<p><strong>     Important Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don’t cut corners on the quality of gears</li>\r\n<li>Understand the function of each gear properly</li>\r\n<li>Acquire your gears well in advance</li>\r\n<li>Eliminate unnecessary luxuries</li>\r\n<li>Seasonal fluctuation will impact the requirement of gear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>      Tips:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can always rent gears if you are not willing to invest</li>\r\n<li>Check the sizes especially of boots before leaving for the mountain</li>\r\n<li>Wear summit socks while trying the boots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 accomodation-block\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"text-box\">\r\n<div class=\"holder\"><strong class=\"title\">Packing List</strong>\r\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\r\n<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thermal Base Layers – Tops and Bottoms</li>\r\n<li>Heavy Base Layers</li>\r\n<li>Trekking Pants</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell pants</li>\r\n<li>Down Pant</li>\r\n<li>T-shirts – Short and long sleeve</li>\r\n<li>Mid Layer Top</li>\r\n<li>Insulated Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Down Jacket/Parka</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Footwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Double insulated mountaineering boots for climbing</li>\r\n<li>Hiking boots (Full and waterproof) for approach</li>\r\n<li>lightweight shoes for camp and around town</li>\r\n<li>Gaiters</li>\r\n<li>Flip-flops</li>\r\n<li>Wool/Synthetic socks</li>\r\n<li>Liner socks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Handwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liner gloves</li>\r\n<li>Mid-weight gloves</li>\r\n<li>Down mittens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Headwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cap/Sun Hat</li>\r\n<li>Buff</li>\r\n<li>Balaclava</li>\r\n<li>Warm wool/Synthetic Hat</li>\r\n<li>Eye Wear (Full coverage around eyes and nose)</li>\r\n<li>Ski Goggles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Climbing Gears</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Helmet</li>\r\n<li>Ice Axe with a waist leash</li>\r\n<li>Mountaineering Crampons</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight Mountaineering Harness</li>\r\n<li>Carabiners (2 Screwgate and 2 Snapgate)</li>\r\n<li>Belay Device(ATC Guide or Figure 8)</li>\r\n<li>Ascender/Jumar</li>\r\n<li>Prussik /Accessory Cord</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Backpacking</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small pack (35-40 liters)</li>\r\n<li>Waterproof duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Padlocks for the duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Pack cover</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>  Accessories</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Water Bottles: 2 bottles of 1 litre each with insulation cover</li>\r\n<li>Trekking poles</li>\r\n<li>Headlamp: 200-300 lumens with spare batteries</li>\r\n<li>Camera</li>\r\n<li>Power bank/Solar Charger</li>\r\n<li>Universal adapter</li>\r\n<li>Notebooks/Diary</li>\r\n<li>Pocket knife</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Hygiene and first aid</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Skincare (Maximum SPF sunscreen and lip balm)</li>\r\n<li>Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Soap, Moisturizer</li>\r\n<li>Hand Sanitizer</li>\r\n<li>Toilet paper and wet wipes</li>\r\n<li>Personal first aid kit (Include personal prescriptions, high altitude medications, painkillers, first-aid tape, band-aids etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Water treatment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Others</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comfort Foods (Bring snacks and foods you like to munch)</li>\r\n<li>Travel clothes to wear in Kathmandu</li>\r\n<li>Sleeping bag (-20 degrees sleeping bag)</li>\r\n<li>Inflatable mattress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Ski Packing List</strong></p>\r\n<p>There’s nothing worse than leaving your ski holiday packing to the last minute and drowning in a pile of gloves, socks and thermals the night before you leave.

Since the trek starts from a mere height of around 800 meters the acclimatization process is gradual and you will reach a high altitude of over 3210 meters</p>\r\n<p>This Short and easy Annapurna Balcony  Trek is best recommended as a family trip and for all those adventure lovers who have limited time to stay in Nepal or who prefer a comparatively easy trekking experience with excellent Himalayan views. Therefore most travel lovers are recommended for this short and easy trek which is less crowded compared to the Annapurna base camp.</p>', '2', NULL, 'annapurna-balcony-trek', 142, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', '1725023424_annapura-balcony-dd-OmOdz.jpg', '', 4, 0, '1', '0', 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-08-28 17:48:08', '2024-10-08 09:51:52'),

Mt. Everest was first summitted in 1953 by Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary via the South Col. Climbing Mt. Everest is certainly a lifetime opportunity. However, Everest expeditions encounter many seen and unseen obstacles including high altitude, harsh weather conditions and even sheer exhaustion. Therefore, we strive hard to conduct the best expedition program putting high importance on the safety aspects of the climb.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;\">Despite being the highest mountains on planet Earth, the Himalayan range of mountains including Mt.

At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather  of the highest peaks in the world. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be  warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. The layering principle, based on several thin layers of insulation (rather than one thick one), covered with an outer weatherproof shell, meets these needs well.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes;\">A Note on Packing </span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes;\">For your international flights we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition.<br>Generally, you will take two duffels up to Base Camp, and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the<br>city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such water, layering, blister kit, and camera. Your climbing gear can be sent on up to Base Camp in a third duffel.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes;\"> </span><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes;\">Gear <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\"> </span>Lists</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes;\">      Climbing Equipment</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">·<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">         </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: \'Cambria\',\'serif\'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes;\">Ice Axe with a leash.

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases.</p>\r\n<p>This list is a guide. While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, use your experience and the listed features to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p>During your time in the mountains, you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather of the highest peaks in the world. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. The layering principle, based on several thin layers of insulation<br>(rather than one thick one), covered with an outer weatherproof shell, meets these needs well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Note on Packing </strong></p>\r\n<p>For your international flights, we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition. Generally, you will take one duffel up to Base Camp, and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such as water, layering, blister kit, and camera.</p>\r\n<p><strong>     Important Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don’t cut corners on the quality of gears</li>\r\n<li>Understand the function of each gear properly</li>\r\n<li>Acquire your gears well in advance</li>\r\n<li>Eliminate unnecessary luxuries</li>\r\n<li>Seasonal fluctuation will impact the requirement of gear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>      Tips:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can always rent gears if you are not willing to invest</li>\r\n<li>Check the sizes especially of boots before leaving for the mountain</li>\r\n<li>Wear summit socks while trying the boots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 accomodation-block\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"text-box\">\r\n<div class=\"holder\"><strong class=\"title\">Packing List</strong>\r\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\r\n<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thermal Base Layers – Tops and Bottoms</li>\r\n<li>Heavy Base Layers</li>\r\n<li>Trekking Pants</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell pants</li>\r\n<li>Down Pant</li>\r\n<li>T-shirts – Short and long sleeve</li>\r\n<li>Mid Layer Top</li>\r\n<li>Insulated Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Down Jacket/Parka</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Footwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Double insulated mountaineering boots for climbing</li>\r\n<li>Hiking boots (Full and waterproof) for approach</li>\r\n<li>lightweight shoes for camp and around town</li>\r\n<li>Gaiters</li>\r\n<li>Flip-flops</li>\r\n<li>Wool/Synthetic socks</li>\r\n<li>Liner socks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Handwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liner gloves</li>\r\n<li>Mid-weight gloves</li>\r\n<li>Down mittens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Headwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cap/Sun Hat</li>\r\n<li>Buff</li>\r\n<li>Balaclava</li>\r\n<li>Warm wool/Synthetic Hat</li>\r\n<li>Eye Wear (Full coverage around eyes and nose)</li>\r\n<li>Ski Goggles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Climbing Gears</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Helmet</li>\r\n<li>Ice Axe with a waist leash</li>\r\n<li>Mountaineering Crampons</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight Mountaineering Harness</li>\r\n<li>Carabiners (2 Screwgate and 2 Snapgate)</li>\r\n<li>Belay Device(ATC Guide or Figure 8)</li>\r\n<li>Ascender/Jumar</li>\r\n<li>Prussik /Accessory Cord</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Backpacking</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small pack (35-40 liters)</li>\r\n<li>Waterproof duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Padlocks for the duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Pack cover</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>  Accessories</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Water Bottles: 2 bottles of 1 litre each with insulation cover</li>\r\n<li>Trekking poles</li>\r\n<li>Headlamp: 200-300 lumens with spare batteries</li>\r\n<li>Camera</li>\r\n<li>Power bank/Solar Charger</li>\r\n<li>Universal adapter</li>\r\n<li>Notebooks/Diary</li>\r\n<li>Pocket knife</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Hygiene and first aid</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Skincare (Maximum SPF sunscreen and lip balm)</li>\r\n<li>Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Soap, Moisturizer</li>\r\n<li>Hand Sanitizer</li>\r\n<li>Toilet paper and wet wipes</li>\r\n<li>Personal first aid kit (Include personal prescriptions, high altitude medications, painkillers, first-aid tape, band-aids etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Water treatment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Others</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comfort Foods (Bring snacks and foods you like to munch)</li>\r\n<li>Travel clothes to wear in Kathmandu</li>\r\n<li>Sleeping bag (-20 degrees sleeping bag)</li>\r\n<li>Inflatable mattress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Ski Packing List</strong></p>\r\n<p>There’s nothing worse than leaving your ski holiday packing to the last minute and drowning in a pile of gloves, socks and thermals the night before you leave.

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases.</p>\r\n<p>This list is a guide. While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, use your experience and the listed features to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p>During your time in the mountains, you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather of the highest peaks in the world. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement. The layering principle, based on several thin layers of insulation<br>(rather than one thick one), covered with an outer weatherproof shell, meets these needs well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Note on Packing </strong></p>\r\n<p>For your international flights, we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition. Generally, you will take one duffel up to Base Camp, and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such as water, layering, blister kit, and camera.</p>\r\n<p><strong>     Important Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don’t cut corners on the quality of gears</li>\r\n<li>Understand the function of each gear properly</li>\r\n<li>Acquire your gears well in advance</li>\r\n<li>Eliminate unnecessary luxuries</li>\r\n<li>Seasonal fluctuation will impact the requirement of gear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>      Tips:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can always rent gears if you are not willing to invest</li>\r\n<li>Check the sizes especially of boots before leaving for the mountain</li>\r\n<li>Wear summit socks while trying the boots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 accomodation-block\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"text-box\">\r\n<div class=\"holder\"><strong class=\"title\">Packing list</strong>\r\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\r\n<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thermal Base Layers – Tops and Bottoms</li>\r\n<li>Heavy Base Layers</li>\r\n<li>Trekking Pants</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell pants</li>\r\n<li>Down Pant</li>\r\n<li>T-shirts – Short and long sleeve</li>\r\n<li>Mid Layer Top</li>\r\n<li>Insulated Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Down Jacket/Parka</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Footwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Double insulated mountaineering boots for climbing</li>\r\n<li>Hiking boots (Full and waterproof) for approach</li>\r\n<li>lightweight shoes for camp and around town</li>\r\n<li>Gaiters</li>\r\n<li>Flip-flops</li>\r\n<li>Wool/Synthetic socks</li>\r\n<li>Liner socks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Handwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liner gloves</li>\r\n<li>Mid-weight gloves</li>\r\n<li>Down mittens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Headwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cap/Sun Hat</li>\r\n<li>Buff</li>\r\n<li>Balaclava</li>\r\n<li>Warm wool/Synthetic Hat</li>\r\n<li>Eye Wear (Full coverage around eyes and nose)</li>\r\n<li>Ski Goggles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Climbing Gears</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Helmet</li>\r\n<li>Ice Axe with a waist leash</li>\r\n<li>Mountaineering Crampons</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight Mountaineering Harness</li>\r\n<li>Carabiners (2 Screwgate and 2 Snapgate)</li>\r\n<li>Belay Device(ATC Guide or Figure 8)</li>\r\n<li>Ascender/Jumar</li>\r\n<li>Prussik /Accessory Cord</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Backpacking</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small pack (35-40 liters)</li>\r\n<li>Waterproof duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Padlocks for the duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Pack cover</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>  Accessories</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Water Bottles: 2 bottles of 1 litre each with insulation cover</li>\r\n<li>Trekking poles</li>\r\n<li>Headlamp: 200-300 lumens with spare batteries</li>\r\n<li>Camera</li>\r\n<li>Power bank/Solar Charger</li>\r\n<li>Universal adapter</li>\r\n<li>Notebooks/Diary</li>\r\n<li>Pocket knife</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Hygiene and first aid</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Skincare (Maximum SPF sunscreen and lip balm)</li>\r\n<li>Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Soap, Moisturizer</li>\r\n<li>Hand Sanitizer</li>\r\n<li>Toilet paper and wet wipes</li>\r\n<li>Personal first aid kit (Include personal prescriptions, high altitude medications, painkillers, first-aid tape, band-aids etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Water treatment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Others</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comfort Foods (Bring snacks and foods you like to munch)</li>\r\n<li>Travel clothes to wear in Kathmandu</li>\r\n<li>Sleeping bag (-20 degrees sleeping bag)</li>\r\n<li>Inflatable mattress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '<p><strong>Three peaks</strong> climbing in Nepal offer an excellent introduction to real Himalayan mountaineering by climbing three moderate-altitude summits in one expedition. we offer  Three Peaks Climbing trip that allows you to ascend Mera Peak[6,461m/21,193ft], Island Peak [6,189m/20,305ft], and Lobuche East Peak[6,119m/20,075ft]  with Amphu Laptcha Pass in a single itinerary at one go.</p>\r\n<p>Our Three Peaks Climbing trip provides an ideal progression and excellent introduction to Himalayan mountaineering and it’s an ideal choice for a true adventure seeker looking for a challenging adventure in the Himalayas.   An achievable expedition for anyone new to climbing with a keen sense of adventure and a desire to learn more about high-altitude mountaineering.An ultimate climbing holiday which includes an ascent of three 6000m peaks and traverse of Amphu Laptcha Pass at 5,700m.</p>\r\n<p>This trip offers an opportunity to partake in a journey that covers a lot of terrains and enables you to make multiple ascents on peaks of moderate elevation.

Ama Dablam is regarded as one of the world’s most beautiful and sought-after peaks, alongside the Matterhorn and Khan Tengri. The main peak is 6,812 meters (22,349 ft), the lower western peak is 6,170 meters (20,243 ft). <strong>Ama Dablam</strong> means “Mother’s necklace”; the long ridges on each side like the arms of a mother (<em>ama</em>) protecting her child, and the hanging glacier thought of as the <em>Dablam</em>, the traditional double-pendant containing pictures of the gods, worn by Sherpa women. For several days,<strong> Ama Dablam</strong> dominates the eastern sky for anyone trekking to Mt Everest base camp and the Khumbu region. Amadablam expedition offers a  moderately superb, technical climbing opportunity to ascend moderately technical, but very climbable snow, ice, and rock surrounded by stunning Himalayan views in a magnificent setting, with numerous cultural and scenic diversions.</p>\r\n<p>The experienced mountaineer will find the South-East Ridge, which is the easiest route on the mountain, a good challenge. Although the height is only 6812m, it is considered one of the technically difficult expeditions in Nepal. The climbers need to have good skills in rock and ice climbing and be technically competent. On most parts of the routes, there will be fixed rope, however, the climbers should posses skills to climb through steep rock and hard water ice, and for the climbers who are climbing for the first time, we recommend acclimatizing on different trekking peaks like Island peak, Mera peak or Labuche East peak.

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases.</p>\r\n<p>This list is a guide. While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, use your experience and the listed features to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p>During your time in the mountains, you will encounter a very wide range of temperatures and weather conditions. At one end of this range is the pleasantly warm and beautiful low land, while at the other end of the spectrum is found the cold and often windy weather of the highest peaks in the world. The equipment you bring must function well in a wide variety of conditions. Your clothing should be warm, lightweight, dry quickly, and allow good freedom of movement.

Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition. Generally, you will take one duffel up to Base Camp, and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such as water, layering, blister kit, and camera.</p>\r\n<p><strong>     Important Notes:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don’t cut corners on the quality of gears</li>\r\n<li>Understand the function of each gear properly</li>\r\n<li>Acquire your gears well in advance</li>\r\n<li>Eliminate unnecessary luxuries</li>\r\n<li>Seasonal fluctuation will impact the requirement of gear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>      Tips:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can always rent gears if you are not willing to invest</li>\r\n<li>Check the sizes especially of boots before leaving for the mountain</li>\r\n<li>Wear summit socks while trying the boots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 accomodation-block\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"text-box\">\r\n<div class=\"holder\"><strong class=\"title\">Equipment Checklist</strong>\r\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\r\n<p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Thermal Base Layers – Tops and Bottoms</li>\r\n<li>Heavy Base Layers</li>\r\n<li>Trekking Pants</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell pants</li>\r\n<li>Down Pant</li>\r\n<li>T-shirts – Short and long sleeve</li>\r\n<li>Mid Layer Top</li>\r\n<li>Insulated Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Hard-shell Jacket</li>\r\n<li>Down Jacket/Parka</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Footwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Double insulated mountaineering boots for climbing</li>\r\n<li>Hiking boots (Full and waterproof) for approach</li>\r\n<li>lightweight shoes for camp and around town</li>\r\n<li>Gaiters</li>\r\n<li>Flip-flops</li>\r\n<li>Wool/Synthetic socks</li>\r\n<li>Liner socks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>    Handwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Liner gloves</li>\r\n<li>Mid-weight gloves</li>\r\n<li>Down mittens</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Headwear</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cap/Sun Hat</li>\r\n<li>Buff</li>\r\n<li>Balaclava</li>\r\n<li>Warm wool/Synthetic Hat</li>\r\n<li>Eye Wear (Full coverage around eyes and nose)</li>\r\n<li>Ski Goggles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Climbing Gears</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Helmet</li>\r\n<li>Ice Axe with a waist leash</li>\r\n<li>Mountaineering Crampons</li>\r\n<li>Lightweight Mountaineering Harness</li>\r\n<li>Carabiners (2 Screwgate and 2 Snapgate)</li>\r\n<li>Belay Device(ATC Guide or Figure 8)</li>\r\n<li>Ascender/Jumar</li>\r\n<li>Prussik /Accessory Cord</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>   Backpacking</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Small pack (35-40 liters)</li>\r\n<li>Waterproof duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Padlocks for the duffel bag</li>\r\n<li>Pack cover</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>   Accessories</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Water Bottles: 2 bottles of 1 litre each with insulation cover</li>\r\n<li>Trekking poles</li>\r\n<li>Headlamp: 200-300 lumens with spare batteries</li>\r\n<li>Camera</li>\r\n<li>Power bank/Solar Charger</li>\r\n<li>Universal adapter</li>\r\n<li>Notebooks/Diary</li>\r\n<li>Pocket knife</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Hygiene and first aid</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Skincare (Maximum SPF sunscreen and lip balm)</li>\r\n<li>Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Soap, Moisturizer</li>\r\n<li>Hand Sanitizer</li>\r\n<li>Toilet paper and wet wipes</li>\r\n<li>Personal first aid kit (Include personal prescriptions, high altitude medications, painkillers, first-aid tape, band-aids etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Water treatment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong> Others</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Comfort Foods (Bring snacks and foods you like to munch)</li>\r\n<li>Travel clothes to wear in Kathmandu</li>\r\n<li>Sleeping bag (-20 degrees sleeping bag)</li>\r\n<li>Inflatable mattress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\r\n<p>As the weather condition is unpredictable in the Himalayan region, you need to be prepared at all times.

You should bring a rucksack or backpack for the gear required during the day. Your pack should contain items such as warm clothes, a jacket, a camera, water bottles, a personal first aid kit, and snacks. The weight limit is 5kg. A porter will carry the rest of your personal equipment packed in a duffel or kit bag. The weight limit for your duffel bag is 15 kg however it is different in the case of peak climbing and expedition.</p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \"><strong>A Note on Packing </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">For your international flights, we recommend that you pack all your equipment in your two duffle bags or suitcase. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA has searched the bags. If not, Lock the bags with Zip Ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip-tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the trek. Generally, you will take one duffel on the trek , and leave one in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for your time in the city. Your trek in duffel will only be accessible in the evenings (with items such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag), and your day pack will hold vitals such as water, layering, blister kit, and camera.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6 accomodation-block\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"text-box\">\r\n<div class=\"holder\"><strong class=\"title\">Equipment and Packing list</strong>\r\n<div class=\"img-holder\">\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \"><strong>FOOTWEAR</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">Hiking Boots with ankle support.

Despite being very close to Kathmandu, the Langtang Region is as wild as any Tibetan highlands with idyllic rural landscape.</p>\r\n<p>The Langtang Valley has long been a favorite trek due to its expansive views, interesting Tamang culture, relatively gentle pace and accessibility from Kathmandu.

It is essential that you take the time to acquire the correct gear; don’t wait for the last minute to find out your local shop doesn’t have your size. This equipment is expensive, but you can often find great sales online and at your local gear store. The purpose of this gear list is to help guide your purchases. Often salespeople in your local shop do not have first hand knowledge of high-altitude climbing, so be sure to balance their advice with what you read here. We have strived to create a list heavy on detail, but there are always further questions!</p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">This list is a guide. While you are required to bring everything on this list, there are numerous options, brands, and versions of each piece of equipment, unless otherwise noted. Using our current suggested brand list we encourage you to shop around, do research, even borrow, and use your experience with our list to find the best gear for you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">Purchasing the specific items listed below will ensure you have the right tool for the job, but there are other options on the market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \"><strong>A note on the packing </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"uk-scrollspy-inview \">For your international 9lights, we recommend that you pack all your<br>equipment in your two larger duf9le bags. Do not simply pack your backpack (since the straps can be damaged by the baggage handling<br>machines). It is important to lock these bags for their trip. Depending<br>on the airport, you may be able to put your travel locks on after TSA<br>has searched the bags. If not, lock the bags with zip ties. If the TSA cuts off the zip tie to search your bag, they will replace it. You will still need the travel locks to lock your bags in the hotel and during the expedition.  Generally, you will take two duffels up to Base Camp, and leave the third in the hotel in Kathmandu with your belongings for time in the city. ONE of the duffels going up to Base Camp can be sent on ahead (with items not needed for the trek in, such as climbing gear) and this bag will not be seen until we arrive at Base Camp. The other will be accessible during the trek in the evenings (with items that are needed for the trek in such as changes of clothing, sleeping bag). SO it’s easy – 1st<br>bag is with you, the 2nd is ahead going up to BC and the 3rd is left<br>behind for afterward – 3 duffels!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-6

He knows the trail tracks even without a map, which I never would have wanted to navigate solo. Nothing is too much trouble for him and he sorts out anything you need with his lovely smile and positive nature (even when climbing big hills!).
